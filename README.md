# ar-access-app

Project website: https://markussaa.github.io/ar-access/

The application uses AR so the device used, a real android phone or an android emulator, needs to support ARCore.

The setup is the same for an emulator as for a physical android device:

* Within the device open up chrome and go to: https://github.com/markussaa/ar-access-app
* Click on view code.
* Click on the file manomotion.apk
* Click on the download button.
* When promted, choose download.
* Click open when the file has been downloaded.
* (If you are promted that you cannot install, follow the steps to allow installation in settings.)
* Open the installed app (named manomotion) and it will run on the device.
* (The password in the app is 1234 and the gesture to do within a box is ðŸ‘Œ)
